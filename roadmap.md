# Project Roadmap: Collaborative AI Node Network

## **Project Purpose**
To build a collaborative network of specialized AI nodes that work together to solve complex tasks. The system will adapt dynamically to user preferences and evolve through iterative feedback.

## **Key Features**
1. Modular design with a base `Node` class and specialized subclasses.
2. Orchestrator to manage task delegation and collaboration.
3. Feedback-driven learning with a preference model.
4. Dynamic node weighting and replacement for continuous improvement.

## **Phases**
### **Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**
- Goal: Create a basic working version of the bot net.
- Deliverables:
  - Base `Node` class and specialized subclasses (`GPTNode`, `HuggingFaceNode`).
  - Orchestrator for task delegation and collaboration.
  - Simple preference model for feedback integration.

### **Phase 2: Adaptive Intelligence**
- Goal: Add iterative feedback loops and weighted node contributions.
- Deliverables:
  - Dynamic weighting system for nodes.
  - Fallback mechanisms for underperforming nodes.

### **Phase 3: Scalability and Refinement**
- Goal: Expand functionality and improve performance.
- Deliverables:
  - Support for additional AI models (e.g., Google Gemini).
  - Advanced preference modeling and real-time collaboration.

## **Sprint Plan**
| Sprint | Duration   | Focus                                      |
|--------|------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Sprint 1 | 2 weeks    | Project setup and base `Node` class.      |
